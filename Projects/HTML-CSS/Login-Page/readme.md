### Login Page
***

#### Objective

The assigned task was to use HTML and CSS to create a typical login page for users.

#### Steps Taken

I started out by creating the container that would hold all of the input forms for the user. Once all the content was present I went to work on styling all the elements using CSS. After playing around with the formatting until I was satisfied with the overall appearance, I finally added media breakpoints so that the page would be responsive.

#### The Result

The final product was a simple front-end login form like you would see used on any webpage or application. This was a quick and practical exercise that brought together some of the basics I learned in the beginning of learning HTML and CSS. This was also my introduction to media breakpoints, which I was really happy to learn about. Media breakpoints help format the page based on the size of the display window and make the page responsive to window resizing and device displays. Media breakpoints are pretty simple but make a world of difference, preserving a neat and optimized layout for your content instead of a static layout that may obscure content or require painful scrolling for the user.
