### SQL Library Database
***

#### Objective
As a final project for my SQL course I was assigned to create a library management system. The project required the build of a database with a specified relational flow chart

#### Steps Taken
The first step I took was to look at the relationships of the flow chart and evaluate which tables would hold mostly their own data and which ones would contain more relationships to other tables. This assisted me in the creation of the database tables. I then created the records and populated all of the tables in the database.

Part of the project was to answer a set of questions by using SQL queries and inner joins. The results of these queries were then made accessible by writing them into a stored procedure.

I have uploaded stored procedures to both [build/populate the database](/Projects/SQL/SP_lib_system_build.sql) and [run queries](/Projects/SQL/Lib%20Project%20SP.sql)

#### The Result
