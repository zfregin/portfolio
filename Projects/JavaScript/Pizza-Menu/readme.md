### Online Ordering Menu
***

#### Objective

The final project of the JavaScript course was to create an online order form for a pizza restaurant using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

#### Steps Taken

I decided to use Bootstrap again to display the menu options. Once the layout was achieved I went to work on constructing the JS functions that would aggregate the selections for each type of pizza option, add all the costs, and display an itemized receipt for order placement. The "client" had specified pricing constraints for the selections that were incorporated into the JS functions.

#### The Result

A functional order page complete with a special homage to the High Priest of Pop, Prince! Have a look [here](https://zfregin.github.io/Pizza%20Project/palace.html). I had a lot of fun with this project. The appearance and styling of the webpage was not a focus or requirement of the project, only functionality was. When I came across the special font style used for the title, however, I just had to incorporate it. This lead to me spend what was probably an equal amount of time on CSS as I did JS. In order to get the title to display nicely I had to toy around with the font CSS quite a bit and learn how the various attributes affected the font. I even got some practice with image editing and CSS when creating the pizza columns. I also got some practice planning implementation for application needs and extensions beyond the specified requirements. Instead of simply passing data values from function to function before listing them on the itemized receipt, I opted to not only add them to the receipt but store the values in an array. In this current version nothing is really done with the array, however I had considered the need to retrieve the values later on. For example, if I want to extend this project and include database functionality then I could do that by simply retrieving the values from the array. Anticipating future needs and requirements is important when implementing code as it can save you some trouble down the road.
